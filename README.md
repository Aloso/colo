## Status

Experimental â€“ expect to see some big changes in the next releases. See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

Installation is explained on the [release page](https://github.com/Aloso/colo/releases).

If you want to build `colo` from source, make sure you have the Rust toolchain (including Cargo) installed. Then clone this repository and run

```fish
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

`colo` recognizes hexadecimal RGB colors as well as HTML color names:

![usage](docs/colo1.png)

Color spaces other than RGB are supported as well:

![usage with other color spaces](docs/colo2.png)

If `colo` is used outside of a terminal, it outputs JSON, because it is the most ubiquitous data exchange format:

### Supported color spaces

| Name    | Short | Description                        | Range of values |
|---------|-------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `rgb`   | `r`   | red, green, blue                   | 0 to 255        |
| `cmy`   | `c`   | cyan, magenta, yellow              | 0 to 1          |
| `cmyk`  | `k`   | cyan, magenta, yellow, key         | 0 to 1          |
| `hsv`   | `v`   | hue, saturation, value             | hue: 0 to 360, saturation: 0 to 1, value: 0 to 1     |
| `hsl`   | `l`   | hue, saturation, light             | hue: 0 to 360, saturation: 0 to 1, light: 0 to 1     |
| `lch`   |       | luminance, chroma, hue             | luminance: 0 to 100, chroma: 0 to 100, hue: 0 to 360 |
| `luv`   |       | CIELUV color (luminance, u, v)     | luminance: 0 to 100, u: -134 to 220, v: -140 to 122  |
| `lab`   |       | CIELAB color (lightness, a, b)     | luminance: 0 to 100, a: ??, b: ??                    |
| `hunterlab` |   | Hunter Lab color (lightness, a, b) | lightness: 0 to 100, a: ??, b: ??                    |
| `xyz`   |       | CIE 1931 XYZ color                 | ??              |
| `yxy`   |       | CIE YXY color                      | ??              |

The most common color spaces (rgb, cmy, cmyk, hsv, hsl) can be abbreviated with a single letter, so instead of writing `colo --rgb 15/0/255`, you can write `colo -r15/0/255`.

### Specifying hexadecimal colors

Hexadecimal colors are just a different notation for RGB colors. They are usually preceded with `#`, but `colo` allows you to omit this character.

Hexadecimal colors can be specified with varying precision: Each color channel can be between 1 and 8 digits long, for example

![hex numbers](docs/colo5.png)

### Default terminal colors

With `--terminal` or `-t`, the default terminal colors are printed:

## Code of Conduct

Since this program is written in Rust, the [Rust code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) applies. Please be friendly and treat everyone with respect.

## Contributing

I appreciate your help! The easiest way to help is to file bug reports or suggest new features in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Aloso/colo/issues).

If you want to create a pull request, make sure the following requirements are met:

  * The code compiles on the latest stable Rust version
  * The code is properly formatted with `cargo fmt`
  * The code is documented
  * If you add a dependency that includes unsafe code, please explain why it is required
  * Please try to keep compile times small, if feasible

That's it! If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue.
